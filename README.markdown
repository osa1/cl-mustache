 - Can CL-JSON convert JSON dictionaries to CL hash-tables instead of plists without modifying JSON data?
 - (Also, converting JSON dictironaries' keys to strings instead of keywords could be useful since I'm reading variables as strings from mustache templates)
 - (Maybe I should use [YASON](http://common-lisp.net/project/yason/) instead of CL-JSON. It has support for converting different JSON data structures to different CL data structures without modifying JSON data)
